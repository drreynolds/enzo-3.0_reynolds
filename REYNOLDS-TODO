In preparation for the Enzo-2.0 code release, I need to do the
following tasks:


Coding [5/1/2010]:
(i) clean up the user interface and default parameters for both the
    gFLDProblem and gFLDSplit modules 
(ii) clean up color field advection to only advect relevant fields, so
    that I don't need to create Helium arrays for Hydrogen-only tests. 
(iii) re-run all regression tests to ensure they work, and generate
    baselines against which future tests can be run. 
(iv) ensure the "evolve" routines set up all relevant units before any
    physics are calculated.



User guides [5/8/2010]:
(i) Update the implicit FLD solver user guide, describing both the
    algorithms and the input parameters. 
(ii) Write the split FLD solver user guide, describing both the algorithms
    and the input parameters. 



Test problems and packaging [5/15/2010]:
In addition to Code and User Guide items, need to write test problem
descriptions for all regression tests (both modules).
