IMPORTANT!

IN macros_and_parameters.h there are two settings that
you may need to change:

#define MAX_NUMBER_OF_SUBGRIDS           2500

#define MAX_POTENTIAL_ITERATIONS            0

For AMR, set MAX_NUMBER_OF_SUBGRIDS = 50000
for a reasonable size AMR run.  I have had to use
up to 300,000 for the 512^3 500Mpc runs.
2500 is enough for any reasonable unigrid run.

You should probably set MAX_POTENTIAL_ITERATIONS = 1
since this is how ENZO has been running for years.
There is a caveat: the answers do not remain bitwise
identical if you set this to > 0 and you use the
fast sibling mods.  I found that the results are
the same if you set this parameter to > 100
but that is too expensive and doesn't make any
sense given the approximation used anyway.
