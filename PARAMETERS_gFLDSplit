Problem Parameter File:
-----------------------
* ProblemType [400<=x<500]
* RadiationFieldType [!=(10 || 11)]
  - must NOT be 10 or 11, since those imply background radiation
    approximations
* RadiativeTransfer [0]
  - disables ray-tracing solver
* RadiativeTransferOpticallyThinH2 [0]
  - disables 1/r^2 approximation for background radiation from stars.
* RadiativeTransferRadiationPressure [0]
  - this must be disabled for now, but eventually I need to allow this
    to be 1, implying that I would fill in the RadiationPressure
    acceleration terms for hydro.
* RadiativeTransferFLD [2]
  - we're using a field-based radiative transfer solver for all
    radiation.  A value of 1 implies that we'll do a field solver for
    optically-thin LW radiation only.
* RadiativeTransferFLDCallOnLevel [0]
  - use field solver on root grid.  Nonzero values would imply that we
    are using solver on a static nested grid (currently unavailable).
* UseHydro [0,1]
  - for radiation/chemistry/heating problems, set to 0; if coupling to
    hydrodynamics then set to 1.
* RadiativeCooling [0]
  - disable pre-existing operator-split radiative cooling module.
* GadgetEquilibriumCooling [0]
  - disable pre-existing operator-split gadget equilibrium cooling module.
* ImplicitProblem [3]
  - 1 specifies this operator-split radiation/chemistry/heating module.
* RadHydroParamfile
  - set to be the file containing all solver-specific parameters
    (below).
  * wanted to set this to default to the main parameter file 
    {cannot do with current call structure}




Current solver params (variable) [default; choices], -options, +comments:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* RadHydroESpectrum (ESpectrum) [0; -1,0,1] 
  - -1 => monochromatic spectrum
  -  0 => power law spectrum
  -  1 => T=10^5 blackbody spectrum

  - 3 => Hydrogen + Helium chemistry
  * change default to 1 for Hydrogen evolution [done]
  + remove Helium as a choice, since never used with this approximation?
* RadHydroHFraction (HFrac) [1.0; 0<=x<=1] 
  + add in check in initalizer to enforce bounds
  + if we remove Helium chemistry as a choice, we should remove this too?

  - 3 => no limiter
  - 4 => ZEUS limiter
  * change default to zeus limiter [done]
  * add in check that input is allowable [done]
  + test out Reynolds limiter for free-streaming problems
  + maybe hard-code in only the one that we want (to improve
    efficiency) and simplify interface?

  - 0 => previous time step
  - 5 => analytical solution to local physics
* RadHydroNewtTolerance (sol_tolerance) [1e-4; x>1e-15]
  + set max value of 1?
