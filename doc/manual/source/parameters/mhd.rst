Magnetohydrodynamic Parameters
------------------------------

``UseDivergenceCleaning`` (external)
    Method 1 and 2 are a failed experiment to do divergence cleaning
    using successive over relaxation. Method 3 uses conjugate gradient
    with a 2 cell stencil and Method 4 uses a 4 cell stencil. 4 is more
    accurate but can lead to aliasing effects. Default: 0
``DivergenceCleaningBoundaryBuffer`` (external)
    Choose to *not* correct in the active zone of a grid by a
    boundary of cells this thick. Default: 0
``DivergenceCleaningThreshold`` (external)
    Calls divergence cleaning on a grid when magnetic field divergence
    is above this threshold. Default: 0.001
``PoissonApproximateThreshold`` (external)
    Controls the accuracy of the resulting solution for divergence
    cleaning Poisson solver. Default: 0.001
``ResetMagneticField`` (external)
    Set to 1 to reset the magnetic field in the regions that are denser
    than the critical matter density. Very handy when you want to
    re-simulate or restart the dumps with MHD. Default: 0
``ResetMagneticFieldAmplitude`` (external)
    The magnetic field values (in Gauss) that will be used for the
    above parameter. Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0
